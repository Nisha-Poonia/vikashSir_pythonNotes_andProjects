Loops: 
Hurdles:
First Level: Where we need to work on elements on 
an iterator or to create elements of a series
Second Level: To find a consolidated result through
elements of an iterator or a series.
like calculate the result of a series:
eg: To find the sum of 1 to 10
To find sum of series like 2sq+3sq+4sq+...10sq
